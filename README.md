# Student-Database-Project

Write a program that uses a class for storing student data. Build the class using the given information.

 - The data should include the studentâ€™s ID number; grades on exams 1, 2, and 3; and average grade.
 - Use appropriate assessor and mutator methods for the grades (new grades should be passed as parameters).
 - Use a mutator method for changing the student ID.
 - Use another method to calculate the average grade.
 - Write a static method that will accept the two students as parameters and report which one has the highest average grade.

Test all constructors and methods using a separate driver class.
